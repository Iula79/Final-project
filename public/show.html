                <strong>Residenza Carducci</strong>* is a Bed and Breakfast in a family-owned four story house, substantially renovated in 1556 with parts dating from the 14th century. It was one of the first inns in Verona, run by the current owner's grandparents.</p>
                <p>When you enter the house you pass through a vaulted entryway completely covered in brick that used to be the entrance of the convent.</p>
            <p>The two suites are on the first floor, independent but adjacent, separated by the laundry room. The top two floors are occupied by the owners. The ground floor, formerly the inn's restaurant, now consists of a small courtyard, office, vaulted
                entryway and garage area.</p>

            <p>Residenza Carducci is located in the historical part of town called Veronetta, on the left side of the Adige river. Veronetta is where the first settlements of the city were and is the home of the roman theatre, the Giardino Giusti and Castel San
                Pietro.

                <strong>Residenza Verazzano</strong>* is a large and modern 3 bedrooms apartment located just outside the walls of the ancient city of Verona, on the top story of a building in a quiet and well-served residential quarter called “quartiere catena”.
            </p>
            <p>This quarter takes its name from a tradition started by the Scaligeri family who, here, erected a tower in the center of the Adige river to collect taxes and duties by pulling a chain across the river and blocking entry to boats which, coming
                from the north, entered the center of the city to carry goods to warehouses and to continue down the river to the Adriatic sea.</p>
            <p>We can still see this tower in the center of the Adige when we enter into Verona.</p>

            <p>It is a large and fully-equipped apartment, ideal for families and longer stays.</p>
            <p>In the winter the apartment is great for guests in Verona for interim work, holidays, business or who attend the city’s theaters for the winter Symphonic and Opera seasons. It is also convenient for visitors and participants in Verona Fairs
                (www.veronafiere.it). </p>
            <p>In the summer the historic center of Verona, an enjoyable walk away passing by the Basilica of San Zeno or over the Castelvecchio bridge, is where guests can enjoy the Arena Opera Season (www.arena.it) and the many summer theater and art events
                (www.estateteatraleveronese.it).
