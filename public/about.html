            <p>GIOVANNA is in perpetual motion: when she is not managing the bed and breakfast, you will find her roaming around
                the city on her bike to go to the latest event or play tennis or skying. Don’t hesitate to ask her for tips
                about the coolest events in town, she is super informed about everything that happens in the city.</br> She
                loves opera and never misses an occasion to go the summer festival in the Arena di Verona. </br>Giovanna is passionate about vintage and
                antiques, therefore restoring the family house was like opening a large treasure chest for her. She couldn't get
                rid of any old flask or broken chair that she found in the house. Everything had to be restored and put to
                new use in Residenza Carducci. </br> Her most prized possession is her old Fiat 500, that she received
                as a graduation present from her parents. She won’t trust anyone else driving it and she has been using it daily for over thirty years to
                go everywhere is too far to reach by bike. </p>

        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>MICHAEL was born in the US but met Giovanna in France, in the summer of '69. He subsequently moved to Italy and
                decided to study architecture. He professed his love for Verona in his
                book “Close Quarters”, that talks in depht about the urbanistic and architectural structure of the city. </br>Michael directed the restoration of the old inn and saw that every detail was
                taken care of. For example, he refused to sand the beams of the house which were covered in paint because that would ruin
                them, and proceeded to remove the paint from each one by hand. </br>He is much easier to get a hold of than
                Giovanna because he’s usually sitting in his studio next to the entrance. Michael’s latest passion project
                is to fix the mountain house, a tiny railway checkpoint building at the feet of the alps.</p>
